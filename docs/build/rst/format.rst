YAML
****

When passing configuration files to this role as parameters, itâ€™s
recommended to add a *.yml* or *.yaml* extension to the each file.

It is also recommended to add three dashes at the top of each file:

::

   ---

You can include in the file the variables required for your tasks:

::

   ---
   packages:
     - [gedit, rolldice]

If you want this role to load list of items from files and URLs you
can set the **expand** variable to *true*:

::

   ---
   packages: /home/username/my-config.yml

   expand: true

If the expand variable is *false*, any file path or URL found will be
treated like plain text.
